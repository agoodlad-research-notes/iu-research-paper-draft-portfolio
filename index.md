During the 2024 fall semester, I taught Logic (Math-M384) as a part-time instructor at IU East. This class is a standard proof-based intrudocution to mathematical logic, good for anyone fresh out of taking an introduction to proofs course. In this class, we learn sentential logic (aka propositional logic); truth assignment functions and truth tables; structural induction and recursion; first order logic; structures and models of theories; (Hilbert) deductive calculus; and the soundness, completeness, and compactness theorems.

My lecture notes for this class, which I would give during my weekly online office hours, are divided by chapters on the book we use, which was the 2nd edition of A Mathematical Introduction to Logic by Herbert B. Enderton.
